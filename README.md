Hi, My Name is Rohit Kumar. I am a CSE student.

I made a beautiful & similar website "Amazon" (Only Covers HTML & CSS Parts in this repository).

In this Front-End project, I have developed a clone of the Amazon homepage using only HTML and CSS. This project is aimed at enhancing my knowledge and skills in the field of Web Development, particularly in front-end programming. The clone focuses on replicating the layout and styling of Amazon's homepage, without adding any interactive functionality or animations.

The project helped me gain hands-on experience in using HTML and CSS for building responsive and visually appealing webpages.
